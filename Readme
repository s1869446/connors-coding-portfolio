so this is a repository(?) where i can show potential employers coding stuff i've done 
all of my projects so far have consisted of some data (usually excel), a jupyter notebook, and a written report where i use the graphs i made in the notebook
my dream is to be able to upload all three things so that the employer can oopen the jupyter notebook, run the code, and then read the report to see how i sued the graphs
part of the point of this is to show growth over time, so I think for now i'm going to upload the original unedited version of what I've done
maybe later i can also upload a more polished version, probably just with more comments or some other edits for readability
i'm also gonna have to fight with anaconda prompt to find all my other jupyter notebooks at some point lol
i may have to ask george for help :$
